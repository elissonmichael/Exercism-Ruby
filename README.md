# Exercism Ruby Code Solutions
*An Easy Way to See Some Ruby Code Refactoring*

Feel free to interact with me through **Issues** or **Pull Requests**. 
You can also comment on any commit.

I'm always trying to keep [every commit organized](https://github.com/elissonmichael/Exercism-Ruby/commits/master), 
you'll see an initial solution for each exercise in a commit, 
followed by every refactor on separated commits.

I'll also comment on commits on specific lines so that you know why the code changed.

Sincerely,
